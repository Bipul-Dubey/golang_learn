========== Go (Golang) ==========
1. GO is compiled language
 execution speed - (compiled language is faster then any interpreted language)
 compilation speed - 
 - go is natively compiled language - code directly compiled to machine code
 
 - every go program start with main.go file from main function

2. Go is Strongly Typed programming language
 - data type checking, have to mention variable data type
 -- Go enforces strong and static typing, meaning variables can only have a single type. 
    A string variable like "hello world" can not be changed to an int, such as the number 3

3. Build in Concurrency (Go-routine)
4. Garbage collection

== Data Type ==
= bool => true, false
= string
= int  int8  int16  int32  int64
= uint uint8 uint16 uint32 uint64 uintptr (non-negative number)
= byte // alias for uint8
= rune // alias for int32
     // represents a Unicode code point
= float32 float64
= complex64 complex128

== Data Type (in print)==
%v - any value at place
%T -> print data type of value
%d -> int
%f, %g -> float (%.2f , it round off to 2 decimal place)
%t -> bool
%q, %s -> string
%e -> scientific notation of value

=== data size represented in bits (float32, float64, int32)

========== packages & modules ==========
packages = folder that has collection of file
module = collection of packages(folder) (when creating project we are creating new module)

================= commands ===============
1. go mod init {module name} ==== init a module file go.mod (start a go project)
2. go run . (if main file is in current dir), go run main.go (location of main.go file)
3. go run main.go = run go main file
4. go mod tidy = adds any missing modules necessary to build the current module's packages and dependencies,
                and it removes unused modules that don't provide any relevant packages
5. go get {packages} = to install any package
